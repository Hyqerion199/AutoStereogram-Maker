# AutoStereogram Maker

Please note that a `requirements.txt` file has not been created for this project yet. ~~It will be made available soon.~~ When I come around to doing it, it will be there.

This project is a Python application that generates autostereograms, also known as "Magic Eye" images, from depth maps. It utilizes the following resources:

- [Video-Depthify](https://github.com/jankais3r/Video-Depthify)
- [Python-Autostereogram](https://github.com/jesstess/python-autostereogram)
- As well as a Paper on AutoStereograms, I'll add it when i locate it again.
## Usage

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `main.py` script.
4. Follow the prompts in the terminal to use the program.
